# RIS mrt files

This is an attempt to create public documentation on top of existing official documentation for RIS data. The idea is that when somebody finds
weird things or discrepancies in the data, they document it here. Large scale data collection inevitably suffers from data collection artefacts,
and a good way to deal with this is to document them.
